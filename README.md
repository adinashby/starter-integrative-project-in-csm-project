# Integrative Project in Computer Science and Mathematics - Project

This template repository is the starter project for Integrative Project in Computer Science and Mathematics Project. Written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### Project Description

Develop a JavaFX program that implements one or more physical, mathematical and/or chemistry concepts you learned throughout your program.

The program should fetch necessary data from a data source, apply a certain logic to the data and then display the different forms of data on a user interface through necessary animations, forms, and graphs.

The program should have the following characteristics:

**Concepts**

- Implements at least one physical or mathematical concept learned in one of the courses. The concept must be of relevance and of an acceptable complexity.

**Interface**

- Displays at least one user interface window using JavaFX or similar technology.
- Displays either an Animation or a Graph (e.g.: bar graph, scatter plot, ...) that refreshes dynamically based on variable parameters.
- The window must have a menu bar with submenus e.g.: File, Edit, Settings > Preferences

**Parameters**

- Has at least one UI Control for a variable input parameter that affects the Animation or the Graph data display. When the parameter variable changes in the control the display should dynamically change the animation or the displayed data.

**Settings**

- Has a “settings” section where at least four setup parameters are configured. The settings screen should be accessible through the Menu. Settings should be from three categories:
   - General Settings: such as setting the data source (e.g.: Database vs XML), the path of some resources (e.g.: images), or others.
   - Animation or Graph settings: secondary parameters that would not affect the physical concept you implemented such as the size of objects in the animation, or vertical graph vs horizontal graph.
   - Theme settings: settings that affect the layout or style of the interface such as the background color, the font size, or others.
- Retrieves data from a data source, e.g.: Database, XML, JSON, or Web.
- Includes a help button and menu item that displays a window where the physical concept and project descriptions are displayed.

### Logistics

1. The teams should be consisted of ==two to four students==.
2. All team members must be implicated in the full development i.e., you should understand and be able to implement all parts of the project. This will be a basis of evaluation.
3.	Each team member should develop at least one part that requires integration with the whole project, it could be the implementation of a related concept, a variation of the concept, or an independent concept that can be integrated with the concepts of the other team members as part of the same application.
