# Integrative Project in Computer Science and Mathematics - Project

This template repository is the starter project for Integrative Project in Computer Science and Mathematics Project. Written in Java, and tested with Gradle/JUnit.

### Project Description

Develop a JavaFX program that implements one or more physical, mathematical and/or chemistry concepts you learned throughout your program.

The program should fetch necessary data from a data source, apply a certain logic to the data and then display the different forms of data on a user interface through necessary animations, forms, and graphs.

The program should have the following characteristics:

**Concepts**

- Implements at least one physical, mathematical or chemistry concept learned in one of the courses. The concept must be of relevance and of an acceptable complexity.

**Interface**

- Displays at least two user interface window using JavaFX.
- Displays either an Animation or a Graph (e.g.: bar graph, scatter plot, ...) that refreshes dynamically based on variable parameters.
- The window must have a menu bar with submenus e.g.: File, Edit, Settings > Preferences

**Parameters**

- Has at least one UI Control for a variable input parameter that affects the Animation or the Graph data display. When the parameter variable changes in the control the display should dynamically change the animation or the displayed data.

**Settings**

- Has a “settings” section where at least four setup parameters are configured. The settings screen should be accessible through the Menu. Settings should be from three categories:
   - General Settings: such as setting the data source (e.g.: Database vs XML), the path of some resources (e.g.: images), or others.
   - Animation or Graph settings: secondary parameters that would not affect the physical concept you implemented such as the size of objects in the animation, or vertical graph vs horizontal graph.
   - Theme settings: settings that affect the layout or style of the interface such as the background color, the font size, or others.
- Retrieves data from a data source, e.g.: Database, XML, JSON, or Web.
- Includes a help button and menu item that displays a window where the physical concept and project descriptions are displayed.

### Logistics

1. The teams should be consisted of ```two to four students max```.
2. All team members must be implicated in the full development i.e., you should understand and be able to implement all parts of the project. This will be a basis of evaluation.
3.	Each team member should develop at least one part that requires integration with the whole project, it could be the implementation of a related concept, a variation of the concept, or an independent concept that can be integrated with the concepts of the other team members as part of the same application.

### Deliverable 1
---
Team members will present their project ideas (PowerPoint) and the selected project description to class.

Each team member must think of and choose a project idea then work with their teammate to select the most convenient/best one. In the proposal PowerPoint, there should be a table containing the information of the following table:

| Project Ideas                            | Description |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Team Member’s name and Project Idea 1:   |             |
| Team Member’s name and Project Idea 2:   |             |
| Team Member’s name and Project Idea 3:   |             |
| Team Member’s name and Project Idea 4:   |             |
| Selected Project Ideas and why:          |             |

The following description should be given in the PowerPoint:

**Concept**
- Describe the physical, mathematical and/or chemistry concept(s) behind the project. 

**Concept Aspects**
- Identify and list the main aspects of the concept such as the problem it addresses, the proposed solution, the solution category among other approaches’ categories. 
- The possible variable parameters that would control the user interface animating the concept.

**Typical Input**
- Describe the typical input for the solution of the applied concept to work.

**Expected Output**
- Describe the expected output and how the user interface would look like and what it would allow the user to do.

**Feasibility**
- List the JavaFX elements and implementation components that you expect to use to implement the project.
- Justify the feasibility in terms of timeline and team tasks assignment.

**Individual part**
- For each team member, describe their individual part and how it would integrate with the whole project with other team members parts.


For this deliverable, you have the following tasks (5%):

- Feasibility - 1%
- Relevance - 1%
- Completeness of the project description - 3%



### Deliverable 2
---
Team members will present their project plan (PowerPoint) to the class.

For this deliverable, the following tasks will be executed:

**Tasks Breakdown, Timeline and Tasks Assignment**

- Create a table and identify the tasks/user stories, to be implemented, assign them to a team member and estimate their durations.
- Create a Jira Kanban board and add all the team members to the board.

**Class Diagram**
- Include a class diagram composed of the key classes that you will be implementing.

**Sample Input and Output Data Grid**
- Include a grid showing sample input and corresponding output data values that will be used to showcase the operating program.

**Wireframes/Mockups**
- Include wireframes of the user interface. 

You could use tools like [Moqups](https://moqups.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for making the mock-up design and wiring.

It is important that the user interface has an area where important data is shown to the users so that they understand what they are looking at. That would include a comprehensive title and updated data values that are reflected in the animation or chart area.

**Sprint Report**
- Include one screenshot of the Trello board in the end of the sprint
- Create a table for the whole team, indicate stories the team starts in this sprint, stories the team resolved.

Create a table for each member, indicate stories she/he received, stories she/he resolved.

For example: 

Sprint 1 - Adin Ashby

| Received Stories          | Resolved Stories         | Carry Over Stories      | Blocked Stories          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| VC-1 Fake story (2)       | VC-1 Fake story (2)      | VC-3 Fake story (3)     |                          |
| VC-3 Fake story (3)       | VC-7 Fake story (1)      |                         |                          |
| VC-7 Fake story (1)       |                          |                         |                          |
| **Total points: 6**       | **Total points: 3**      | **Total points: 3**     | **Total points: 0**      |
